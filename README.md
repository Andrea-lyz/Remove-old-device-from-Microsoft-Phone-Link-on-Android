Remove old device from Microsoft Phone Link on Android

As we all know, Windows Phone Link has always had the issue of not being able to delete old devices. Not long ago, Microsoft finally added a "Delete" button to the Phone Link on PC through an update, but they seem to have deliberately overlooked the Android side. Even now, some users (myself included) still have a bunch of "ghost" devices in their device list.
